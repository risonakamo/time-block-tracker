# time block
- [x] scrollable time rows
- [x] running version of time row
    - time row could have special icon or something in the time field while it is ongoing. maybe a clock icon?
- [x] running version of whole time block
- [x] special styling when it is empty of time rows
- [x] stop button version of time block

# time row
- [ ] hovering over time row time fields should show a longer date including the year. so might need to change the input to time row to dates instead of strings?
